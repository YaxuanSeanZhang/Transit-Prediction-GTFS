    "- To study individual public transit trip route, it is important to know single trip step, i.e. origin, each transit route, boarding, and alighting stop. However, Transit Onboard Dataset only has individual transfer route description instead of transfer stop information, which would lead to the incompleteness data structure of individual trip.The project aims to use GTFS(General Transit Feed Specification) to reconstruct and visualize individual trip data, by matching two above datasets and predicting individual transfer trip.\n",
    "- In this project, the possible trip is predicted govern by the transit schedule (i.e. date and hour), trip direction, minimum distance rule.\n",
    "- The expected result is one reconstructed individual trip table, and an interactive visualization of invidual trip."
